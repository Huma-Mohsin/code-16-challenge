let lptp_obj = {
This line declares a variable lptp_obj and assigns it an object.

    make: "LENOVO",
Within the object, a property make is defined with the value "LENOVO".

    model: "IdeaPad 3 ci5",
Another property model is defined with the value "IdeaPad 3 ci5".

    year: "2022",
Yet another property year is defined with the value "2022".

    describe: function() {
Here, a method named describe is defined within the object using a function expression.

        console.log(`This laptop is ${this.model} and it is made by ${this.make} in the year ${this.year}`);

Inside the describe method, a string is logged to the console using console.log(). The string contains placeholders ${this.model}, ${this.make}, and ${this.year} which are replaced by the corresponding values of the model, make, and year properties of the lptp_obj object respectively. The this keyword refers to the current object, lptp_obj, within which the describe method is defined.

    }
};
The closing curly brace marks the end of the object definition.

lptp_obj.describe();
Finally, the describe method of the lptp_obj object is called, resulting in the execution of the code within the method.
This is how each line of your code works together to define an object representing a Lenovo IdeaPad 3 ci5 laptop and display its details using the describe method.
